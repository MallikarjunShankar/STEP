# UC 2

## Overview

The **OOPS Banner App (UC2)** is a Java console application that displays the word **"OOPS"** in a stylized banner format using ASCII art. The program prints the banner by combining asterisks (`*`) and spaces to visually construct each letter, producing a decorative console output.

Unlike the previous version, this application focuses on visual presentation by printing multiple formatted lines that together form the banner.

## Purpose

This application extends the first user story by helping understand:

- Structured console output formatting in Java  
- Creating visual text using ASCII characters  
- String concatenation for formatted printing  
- Using multiple `System.out.println()` statements  
- Enhancing basic programs with presentation-focused output  
- Program readability and documentation using comments

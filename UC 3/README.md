# UC 3

## Overview

The **OOPS Banner App (UC3)** is a Java console application that displays the word **"OOPS"** in a stylized ASCII banner format. This version improves upon the previous implementation by constructing each banner line using the `String.join()` method instead of traditional string concatenation.

The application focuses on enhancing code readability, maintainability, and efficiency while producing the same visual banner output.

## Purpose

This application extends Use Case 2 to help understand:

- Efficient string handling in Java  
- The use of `String.join()` for combining multiple strings  
- Improving code readability and structure  
- Avoiding inefficiencies caused by repeated string concatenation (`+` operator)  
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable console applications
